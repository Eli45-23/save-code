## Implementation Details

This plan will implement:
1. **Auto-incrementing sequences** - Files get automatic sequence numbers
2. **Smart date tracking** - Enhanced date displays and ordering
3. **Visual sequence indicators** - Users can see file order clearly
4. **Flexible reordering** - Users can adjust file sequences
5. **Performance optimized** - Efficient database queries for large file lists

## Priority
HIGH - User experience improvement for file organization

- Created auto-incrementing sequence triggers
- Enhanced date tracking with better granularity
- Added comprehensive database functions for sequence management

✅ **Backend Integration**
- Updated Supabase helpers for sequence handling
- Modified file queries to use enhanced ordering
- Added sequence reordering functionality
- Implemented intelligent sequence assignment

✅ **UI Improvements**
- Enhanced FileCard component with sequence numbers
- Improved date formatting with relative times

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Smart File Sequencing**
   - Files automatically get sequence numbers on creation
   - Existing files backfilled with sequences based on creation date
   - Manual sequence reordering capability

2. **Enhanced Sorting Options**
   - Sequence order (default)
   - Recently updated
   - Recently created
   - Recently accessed

3. **Improved Date Display**
   - Relative time formatting ("2h ago", "3d ago")
   - Context-aware date icons
   - Better timestamp granularity

4. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Sequence number badges
   - Sort filter buttons
   - Enhanced FileCard layout

### Pending Tasks

- [ ] Add user preferences for sequence behavior
- [ ] Test sequence reordering functionality in UI
- [ ] Run database migration in Supabase Dashboard

### Migration Required

⚠️ **Important**: The database migration must be run manually in Supabase SQL Editor:
1. Copy contents of `supabase/enhance_file_sequencing.sql`
2. Execute in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
3. Verify with test queries

### Impact

This implementation provides:
- Better file organization with intuitive sequencing
- Multiple sorting options for different user workflows
- Enhanced visual feedback with sequence numbers
- Improved date handling for better UX
- Performance-optimized database queries
- Backward compatibility with existing data
