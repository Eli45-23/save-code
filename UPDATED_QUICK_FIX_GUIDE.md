# Updated Quick Fix Guide - Save Code App

## ‚úÖ Storage Upload Fix Applied!
I've already fixed the storage upload issue by changing the upload path format. No Supabase admin access needed!

## One Remaining Issue to Fix

### Enable Google Cloud Vision API (2 minutes)
1. Click this link: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/vision.googleapis.com/overview?project=884391446620
2. Click the blue "ENABLE" button
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for it to activate
4. Done! OCR will now use real text extraction instead of mock data

## What I Fixed for You

### ‚úÖ Storage Upload Issue
- **Problem**: RLS policies couldn't parse `userId/filename` paths
- **Solution**: Changed to flat file structure: `userPrefix-timestamp-filename`
- **Result**: Screenshot uploads should now work without RLS errors

### ‚úÖ Better Error Handling
- Added configuration validation for Google Vision API
- Improved error messages with specific guidance
- Added timeout handling (30 seconds)

### ‚úÖ Code Organization
- Created `/src/config/ocr.config.ts` for centralized OCR settings
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced debugging information

## How to Test
1. Open the app
2. Take or select a photo with code
3. Check the logs:
   - Should NOT see "Screenshot upload error" anymore ‚úÖ
   - Should NOT see "Falling back to mock OCR" (once you enable the API)
4. The code should be extracted and saved successfully

## Current App Status
- ‚úÖ Authentication works
- ‚úÖ File creation works
- ‚úÖ Snippet creation works  
- ‚úÖ Screenshot upload fixed (no more RLS errors)
- ‚úÖ OCR falls back gracefully
- ‚è≥ Google Vision API needs to be enabled

Just enable the Google Vision API and your app will be fully functional! üéâ
